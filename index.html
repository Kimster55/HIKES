                    <h3>Sand Dunes along the North Sea</h3>
                    <p>There’s hardly a more quintessentially Danish seaside than the wide, white sandy beaches along Jutland’s West coast. Day trippers drive their cars right onto Blokhus Strand and step out onto the windy coast to admire the waves of the North Sea. Sand dunes line the coast and are covered with the robust lyme and marram grass, which help the dunes to survive the strong winds. Pockets of wind shelter between the dunes are perfect for soaking up the sun on a warm Spring day. <a href="https://www.visitjammerbugten.dk/ln-int/jammerbugten/nature/blokhus-beach-0" target="_blank">Read more about Blokhus Strand</a>
